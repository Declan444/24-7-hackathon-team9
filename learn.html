                        <h3>Abro (sexual and romantic)</h3>
                        <p>
                          A word used to describe people who have a fluid sexual
                          and/or romantic orientation which changes over time,
                          or the course of their life. They may use different
                          terms to describe themselves over time.

                        <p>
                          An umbrella term used specifically to describe a lack
                          of, varying, or occasional experiences of sexual
                          attraction. This encompasses asexual people as well as
                          those who identify as demisexual and grey-sexual. Ace
                          people who experience romantic attraction or
                          occasional sexual attraction might also use terms such
                          as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction
                          with asexual to describe the direction of their
                          romantic or sexual attraction.

                          Allo people experience sexual and romantic attraction,
                          and do not identify as on the ace or aro spectrum.
                          Allo is to ace and aro spectrum identities, as
                          straight is to LGB+ spectrum identities. It is
                          important to use words that equalise experience,
                          otherwise the opposite to ace and aro becomes ‘normal’
                          which is stigmatising.
